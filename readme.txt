Makes it easy for LTR language speaker to test the RTL website layout by mirroring it so it looks like LTR.


== Description ==

This plugin simply mirrors the Right To Left (RTL) website layout using a CSS transform making it look like Left To Right (LTR) website.

This is a great tool for LTR language speakers for testing RTL layouts of WordPress themes and plugins, making the testing process much easier for you eyes and brain ;)

Works great with [RTL Tester](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rtl-tester/) plugin.

= Features =

* Mirrors RTL website layout to make it look like LTR layout
* Plugin adds a blue notification with "Mirrored RTL" text at the top when the RTL website is mirrored

= Plugin Localization =

Translate the plugin by clicking the **"Translate RTL Tester Mirror"** button under the "Translations" section in the sidebar.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin download file and upload `rtl-tester-mirror` folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the *"Plugins"* menu in WordPress.
3. Switch your website into RTL layout (with [RTL Tester](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rtl-tester/) plugin, for example).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The WordPress toolbar no longer sticks! How come? =

Well, this seems to be a bug with your browser. The plugin actually applies a CSS transform on a `html` tag and some browsers can't cope with fixed positioned elements than. Sorry for inconvenience, but there is no real fix for this as of now. But I believe this is a small issue in comparison of the value the plugin gives you ;)

= Fixed positioned elements are not working, help! =

Well, the same as above...
